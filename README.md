A note-taking webapp based on the design principle of not using the mouse.

Why?

Because sometimes muscle memory is so good with the fingers on keys that you can do what you need to do with your eyes closed. Can't use a mouse with your eyes closed, can you?

No bells and whistles here, but the core functionality is solid and the app can easily be extended/stylized.
